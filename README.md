# Machine-Translation-HuggingFace-Streamlit

Machine Translation using pre-trained model from Hugging Face Helsinki University NLP Model with Streamlit UI

Currently has Danish <--> English translation 

Solution Highlights:

1. Works on a pre-trained NLP Transformer model 

2. Provides state-of-the-art translation quality, comparable to Google translation

3. Completely self-contained solution without dependency on internet â€“ no issue of data privacy 

4. Coded in Python, so we have complete control over user data storage and transmission outside our system boundaries



Possibilities:

1. Possible to deploy this functionality on say, an Ubuntu instance in AWS and expose as a webservice 

2. No other cost than deployment / hosting

3. The Nordic multi-lingual translation can also be achieved with similar approach  



Limitation: 

The only disadvantage currently is the computational response time, which ranges from 11-15 seconds
